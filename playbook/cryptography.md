# Cryptography

You will encounter a wide variety of cryptographic techniques in CTFs, but some fruit hangs lower than others, and I am trying to build some reusable modules to aid us.

A few ciphers I've encountered so far:

 * Caesar (`scripts/examples/crypto/caesar.rb`)
 * Vigen√®re
 * Scytale transposition cipher
 * Substitution cipher
