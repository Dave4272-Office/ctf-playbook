# Miscellaneous

Some things to note:

 * It's extremely common for the title to be a clue. Even if it's not an obvious one, keep it in mind as it may become useful part way through the challenge.
 * Google everything.
 * Look for non obvious avenues of attack. If a challenge gives away any side channel information, you may be expected to use it.
 * Don't dismiss the obvious - even though is misleading from time to time, following the most obvious hints can easily lead to success, especially for the lower-score challenges.
