# Steganography

## Images

 1. Anything in the exif metadata?
 1. What file format is it? Different image formats provide different avenues for hiding data.
 1. Does playing about with levels/curves reveal the flag?
 1. Is the flag hidden in only one of the colour channels?

## Text

 1. Are there seemingly superfluous tabs/spaces at the end of lines? It could be a [whitespace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29) program.
