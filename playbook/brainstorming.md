# Brainstorming

This section is intended as brainstorming playground to note down ideas that might be worthy of implementing

 * Since we now have a teamaddress, sloths@slothkrew.com, it might be not the worst idea to rework the homepage a little bit. Not only to include said address, but maybe start publishing writeups or give generally a bit more information about ourselves
 * The tooldump should be reworked.. dot|not, fix this!
 * Even though we are registered on CTFTime as a team, taking a more planned approach could be nice - some sort of calendar-app? (Also: We should update our mailaddress there)
 * 'I'll totally write that down as a write-up so I can use it later' - famous last words. Writeups would help us not to forget that 'totally obvious thing' we missed. Yet we really lack the patience to actually write some. Maybe we should make them publicly available in order to put us under some peer pressure. (plsnowordpress)
