# Brainstorming

This section is intended as brainstorming playground to note down ideas that might be worthy of implementing

 * We're currently registering for CTFs with a player's mailaddress - maybe something like sloths@slothkrew.com where everybody has access to would be useful.
 * Every CTF it's the same problem: You need this tool or that tool or you would need yet another copy of Kali, but the download is costing you tons of time because the mirrors are slow - maybe we could set up a tools-repository or virtualbox-image on a private box to make sure we can access it fast?
 * Even though we are registered on CTFTime as a team, taking a more planned approach could be nice - some sort of calendar-app?
