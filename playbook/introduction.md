# Introduction

This set of documents is primarily intended as a set of personal notes, tips, tricks and scripts related to performing well in capture the flag competitions. With any luck, it can also be of use to others, particularly my friends and team mates from https://slothkrew.com / #slothkrew.

Little effort will be made to explain techniques, as there are many better resources to learn from if you want to understand the topic. Also, I don't know what I'm doing. Rather, this is more of a checklist of approaches to take when presented with a challenge in a CTF, based on my limited previous experience in CTFs.
